#Script for building glycans. Ideally, the option for building glycans based on IUPAC polysaccharide nomenclature would be useful, but 
#perhaps it would be easier to build glycan geometry files based on a matrix input with SMILES string modifications (sulfate, phosphate, 
#N-acetyl, etc...)
#The library represents a series of geometrically defined monosaccharides which the function will draw from in order to build the glycan 
#structure.
